# stock_pitch

This repository contains an archive of my previous stock pitches. I find it very useful to re-read these and examine any changes in my investment philosophy. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me at jaiveerk@usc.edu. I'm always happy to discuss ideas, explain my rationale at the time, and welcome any and all challenges to my investment theses. Do bear in mind the date that they were created!
